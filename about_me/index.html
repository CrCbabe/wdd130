    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Conner Cobabe</h2>
    <p>Hello, my name is Conner Cobabe. I am 20 years old, and have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints all my life. I am unmarried, and am currently living at home with my parents whilst I serve a church service mission. I served as proselyting mission last year, came home halfway through, choosing to serve the remainder of my mission as a service missionary. I get the opportunity and blessing to serve in the temple, at the Bishop's Storehouse, and locally in my community. I am grateful to be serving my God, regardless of how I do so.</p>
    <p>When it comes to my education, I am planning to major in computer science. I hope to be able to work in the video game industry, be it as a designer, an entertainer, or as a voice actor. By taking this class in web design, I believe I can greater understand how to design things that are efficient, as well as aesthetically pleasing, for both websites and in general.</p>
